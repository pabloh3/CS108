The correct project directory to import into Android Studio is the "Tetris" directory.

Don't forget you'll need to manually copy over your Board.java and Piece.java files to get Android Tetris to work.

Also don't forget we want your Piece and Board tests in your final HW3 zip submission file (see HW3 handout).
